     <p>This is such an easy recipe that I can throw together super fast at the end of a long, hard day. It packs a punch of flavor
        with very little effort. My kids love this and request it often. Sometimes, I even make a few extra to go in their lunch boxes
        the next day.   This is such an easy recipe that I can throw together super fast at the end of a long, hard day. It packs a punch of flavor
